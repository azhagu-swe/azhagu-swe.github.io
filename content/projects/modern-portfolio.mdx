# Overview

This **Modern Portfolio** serves as a comprehensive demonstration of **Full-Stack Development** capabilities, leveraging **Next.js 16** and the App Router to achieve exceptional performance scores. By integrating **Turbopack**, I optimized the build process to minimize deployment times while ensuring a responsive, accessible user experience.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Theming System
Designed with accessibility in mind, the theming system utilizes `next-themes` to provide:
- **Paper**: A high-readability light mode for long-form content.
- **OLED**: A battery-saving deep black mode optimizing contrast.
- **Matrix**: A developer-centric custom theme showcasing CSS variable mastery.

### 2. Custom MDX Engine
To bypass standard CMS limitations, I built a custom **MDX Engine**. This allows for:
- Server-side rendering of rich content.
- Direct hydration of React components like `<Button />` within markdown.
- Optimizing First Contentful Paint (FCP) by reducing client-side JavaScript.

```tsx
// Example of embedded React component in Markdown
<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Integrating PWA with Turbopack
Enabling Offline capabilities required configuring `next-pwa` to work seamlessly with the new bundling architecture of Next.js 16. I addressed module resolution conflicts by implementing a custom Webpack fallback strategy.
