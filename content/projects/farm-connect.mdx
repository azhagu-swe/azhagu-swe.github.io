### The Problem

In today's market, local farmers often struggle to connect directly with consumers, leading to reliance on intermediaries which reduces their profits and increases prices for the end customer. There was a clear need for a digital platform that could bridge this gap, creating a transparent and efficient marketplace for fresh, local produce. The challenge was to build a comprehensive e-commerce solution that catered to the distinct needs of three user groups: consumers (Buyers), producers (Farmers), and platform administrators (Admins).

### My Solution

I architected and developed **FarmConnect**, a full-stack, role-based e-commerce application from the ground up. The solution was designed to be secure, scalable, and user-friendly.

1.  **Backend Architecture:** I built a robust backend using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, creating a set of RESTful APIs to handle all business logic. To ensure security, I implemented **Spring Security** to manage authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that users could only access features relevant to their role (e.g., a farmer cannot see an admin dashboard). Data persistence was handled by a **PostgreSQL** database.

2.  **Frontend Experience:** The frontend was crafted with **React** and **TypeScript**, providing a modern, type-safe, and responsive user experience. I designed and built distinct, intuitive dashboards for each user role:

    - **Buyers:** Can browse products, filter by category, add items to a shopping cart, and complete a secure, multi-step checkout process.
    - **Farmers:** Can manage their product listings (create, update, delete), view orders, and track their sales.
    - **Admins:** Have a comprehensive overview of the platform, with the ability to manage users and monitor all platform activity.

3.  **Deployment:** The entire application was containerized using **Docker**, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment for both development and production deployment.

### Outcome

The result is a fully functional e-commerce platform that successfully empowers local farmers by providing them with a direct sales channel, while offering consumers access to fresh produce at fair prices. The role-based architecture ensures the system is secure and easy to manage, providing a solid foundation for future growth and feature additions.
